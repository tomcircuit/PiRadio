    eccp1.c

  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the ECCP1 driver using MPLAB® Code Configurator

  @Description
    This header file provides implementations for driver APIs for ECCP1.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB® Code Configurator - v2.10.3
        Device            :  PIC18F45K22
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 v1.34
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X 2.26

  @Description
    This routine is used to determine if data capture is completed.
    When data capture is complete routine returns 1. It returns 0 otherwise.

  @Preconditions
    ECCP1_Initialize()function should have been called before calling this function.

  @Returns
   true - Indicates compare is complete
   false - Indicates compare is not complete

  @Param
    None
